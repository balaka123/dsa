Problem Statement:
At the government hospital treating patients for Covid, the management is preparing a token system that gives priority to senior citizens who want to get tested over other patients. As the patients keep coming and registering, they are added to a priority queue from which patient’s names are called out for testing. Anticipating a rise in the number of cases across the world, an appointment software has to be developed to manage this priority effectively. The application should be able to: 
1. Take the patient’s age and create a patient ID in the following format: where xxxx is the patient id and yy is the patient’s age 
2. Insert the patient id in the priority queue based on the age of the patient. 
3. If x testing counters got vacant, display the next set of patient IDs and corresponding names that should go for testing and remove them from the priority queue.
